# MinimalistSearchEngine
The basic idea is that the program reads data from the input file "Medicament.txt" and stores it into memory. Every time I want to search information about a specific drug, I need to write it down into console. <br />
Event if the name was not perfectly introduced, a missspell happened, the input value is compared with all the values stored in memory. If an approx. value was found, then it is returned and printed.
